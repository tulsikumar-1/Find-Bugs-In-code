# Find-Bugs-In-code
The purpose of this program is to develop and algorithm to find the bug in the code.
The dataset with the tags is used to train the model and validate the model and the other dataset is used to predict the model. Train Dataset have six columns, five of which consist features and the sixth column contains tags. The five columns contain text features so to convert them in numerical form Term Frequency â€” Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) is used. 
# The model applied are Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
